This is even more important in the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An optimum result can only be achieved with a holistic approach and active patient participation with the support of appropriate diabetes education and lifestyle modification.

This has been reflected in the latest Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM (6th Edition). These guidelines also focus on preventing and reducing diabetes-related complications, thereby improving clinical outcomes.

I have been a champion for embracing technology and innovation – and note that there is emphasis on the potential to use mobile apps and other forms of technological advances / telemedicine to improve diabetes self-management.

On the other hand, prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia continues to rise unabated. The 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) shows a prevalence of 18.3% (for adults >18 years of age), a 4% increase from 2015; 48.6% were undiagnosed. In addition, ~5.0% of our young Malaysians between 18-29 years are also diabetic. It is worrying to see this trend. The frequent co-existence with other well-known comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, overweight/ obesity further complicates the situation. The 5th edition of our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM 2015, was detailed"

Since then, there have been major advances; in therapeutics, nutrition, technology as well as, digital health. The landmark CVOTs have consistently demonstrated positive beneficial CV outcomes in those with either established or at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Another exciting advance has been the discovery of a 2nd therapeutic class of agent, apart from the renin-angiotensin system blockers, to directly reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD remains the largest contributor of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia and, recent renal outcome trials definitively show positive outcomes for"

First generation sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide): generally, should be avoided due to long half-life and risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with CKD. Gliclazide and glipizide are the preferred agents among the second- generation sulphonylureas as they do not have active metabolites and have lower risk of hypoglycaemia in CKD patients. § Metformin is eliminated via kidney and may accumulate in body as kidney function deteriorates, increase risk of lactic acidosis. ¶SGLT2-i – eGFR below which this class of agents can be prescibed is expected to change, with the advent of their significant reno-protective and cardio-protective benefits; however, the indication may be for their reno and cardio-protective benefits"

Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence Questionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using carbon monoxide (CO) breath analyser (IF AVAILABLE). 4. Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless contraindicated. 5. If selected, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least eight to twelve weeks, whereas varenicline should be used for at least twelve weeks. 6.
