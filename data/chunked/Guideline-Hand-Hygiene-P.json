Review of the Scientific Data Regarding Hand Hygiene Historical Perspective For generations, handwashing with soap and water has been considered a measure of personal hygiene (1). The concept of cleansing hands with an antiseptic agent probably emerged in the early 19th century. As early as 1822, a French pharmacist demonstrated that solutions containing chlorides of lime or soda could eradicate the foul odors associated with human corpses and that such solutions could be used as disinfectants and"

In a paper published in 1825, this phar- macist stated that physicians and other persons attending patients with contagious diseases would benefit from moist- ening their hands with a liquid chloride solution (2). In 1846, Ignaz Semmelweis observed that women whose babies were delivered by students and physicians in the First Clinic at the General Hospital of Vienna consistently had a higher mortality rate than those whose babies were delivered by midwives in the Second Clinic (3). He noted that physi- cians who went directly from the autopsy suite to the obstet- rics ward had a disagreeable odor on their hands despite washing their hands with soap and water upon entering"

Per- haps because of the known deodorizing effect of chlorine com- pounds, as of May 1847, he insisted that students and physicians clean their hands with a chlorine solution between each patient in the clinic. The maternal mortality rate in the First Clinic subsequently dropped dramatically and remained low for years.

In 1843, Oliver Wendell Holmes concluded independently that puerperal fever was spread by the hands of health person- nel (1). Although he described measures that could be taken to limit its spread, his recommendations had little impact on 2 MMWR October 25, 2002 obstetric practices at the time.

At the time, recommendations directed that personnel wash their hands with soap and water for 1–2 minutes before and after patient contact. Rinsing hands with an antiseptic agent was believed to be less effective than handwashing and was recom- mended only in emergencies or in areas where sinks were un- available.

In 1988 and 1995, guidelines for handwashing and hand antisepsis were published by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control (APIC) (7,8). Recommended indications for handwashing were similar to those listed in the CDC guide- lines.

Total bacterial counts on the hands of medical personnel have ranged from 3.9 x 104 to 4.6 x 106 (14–17). In 1938, bacteria recov- ered from the hands were divided into two categories: tran- sient and resident (14).

This layer also contains melanocytes involved in skin pigmentation; Langerhans cells, which are important for antigen presentation and immune responses; and Merkel cells, whose precise role in sensory reception has yet to be fully delineated. As keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation, they begin to flatten out and assume the dimensions charac- teristic of the corneocytes (i.e., their diameter changes from 10–12 µm to 20–30 µm, and their volume increases by 10- to 20-fold).

Barrier function does not simply arise from the dying, degeneration, and compaction of the underlying epidermis. Rather, the processes of cornifica- tion and desquamation are intimately linked; synthesis of the stratum corneum occurs at the same rate as loss.

Experimental manipulations that disrupt the skin barrier include 1) extraction of skin lip- ids with apolar solvents, 2) physical stripping of the stratum corneum using adhesive tape, and 3) chemically induced irri- tation. All of these experimental manipulations lead to a decreased skin barrier as determined by transepidermal water loss (TEWL).

In 1994, the FDA TFM classified ethanol 60%–95% as a Category I agent (i.e., generally safe and effective for use in antiseptic handwash or HCW hand-wash products) (19). Although TFM placed isopropanol 70%–91.3% in category IIIE (i.e., insuffi- cient data to classify as effective), 60% isopropanol has subse- quently been adopted in Europe as the reference standard against which alcohol-based hand-rub products are compared (79).

Allergic contact dermati- tis or contact urticaria syndrome caused by hypersensitivity to alcohol or to various additives present in certain alcohol hand rubs occurs only rarely (167,168). Alcohols are flammable. Flash points of alcohol-based hand rubs range from 21ºC to 24ºC, depending on the type and concentration of alcohol present (169).

Among these, being a physician or a nursing assistant, rather than a nurse, was consistently associated with reduced adherence (Box 1). In the largest hospitalwide survey of hand-hygiene practices among HCWs (11), predictors of poor adherence to recom- mended hand-hygiene measures were identified.

Because soaps and detergents can damage skin when applied on a regular basis, HCWs must be better informed regarding the possible adverse effects associated with hand-hygiene agents. Lack of knowledge and education regarding this subject is a barrier to motivation.

Further, using alcohol-based hand rubs may be a better option than traditional handwashing with plain soap and water or antiseptic handwash, because they not only require less time (166,318) but act faster (1) and irritate hands less often (1,67,96,98,166).
