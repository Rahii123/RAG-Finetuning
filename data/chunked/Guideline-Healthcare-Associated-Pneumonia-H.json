Among the changes in the recommendations to prevent bacterial pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, are the preferential use of oro-tracheal rather than naso- tracheal tubes in patients who receive mechanically assisted ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation to reduce the need for and duration of endotracheal intubation, changing the breathing circuits of ventilators when they malfunction or are visibly contaminated, and (when feasible) the use"

In 1994, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) (then known as the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) revised and expanded the CDC Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia to include Legionnaires disease and pulmonary aspergillosis (1).

In response to this demand, HICPAC revised the guideline to cover these other settings. However, infection-control data about the acute-care hospital setting are more abundant and well analyzed compared with those from long-term care, ambulatory, and psychiatric facilities and other health-care settings.

Hospital-Associated (Nosocomial) Pneumonia Pneumonia has accounted for approximately 15% of all hospital-associated infections and 27% and 24% of all infections acquired in the medical intensive-care unit (ICU) and coronary care unit, respectively (4-6).

In other reports, patients receiving continuous mechanical ventilation had 6-21 times the risk of developing hospital-associated pneumonia compared with patients who were not receiving mechanical ventilation (10-12).

In studies in which invasive techniques were used to diagnose VAP, the crude mortality rates ranged from 4% in patients with VAP but without antecedent antimicrobial therapy (29) to 73% in patients with VAP caused by Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter spp. (30), and attributable mortality rates ranged from 5.8% to 13.5% (31;32).

Analyses of pneumonia-associated morbidity have shown that hospital-associated pneumonia can prolong ICU stay by an average of 4.3-6.1 days and hospitalization by 4-9 days (26;28;29;31;33;35;36). An estimate of the direct cost of excess hospital stay due to VAP is 8 $40,000 per patient (33). B.

Although clinical criteria together with cultures of sputum or tracheal specimens may be sensitive for bacterial pathogens, they are highly nonspecific, especially in patients with VAP (46;48-51); conversely, culture of blood has a very low sensitivity (52). In 1992, a group of investigators recommended standardized methods for diagnosing pneumonia in clinical research studies of VAP (53-55). These methods involved bronchoscopic techniques, e.g., quantitative culture of protected specimen brush (PSB) specimen (56-65), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (57;66-72),"

Because these techniques are invasive, they can cause complications such as hypoxemia, bleeding, or arrhythmia (51;58;70;77-79). Quantitative culture of endotracheal aspirate (80;81) and non-bronchoscopic procedures that utilize blind catheterization of the distal airways, e.g., nonbronchoscopic-pBAL (66;82) and nonbronchoscopic-PSB (65;83;84), were developed later and were shown to approximate the sensitivity and specificity of bronchoscopic techniques"

Hospital-Associated Pneumonia The reported distribution of etiologic agents causing hospital-associated pneumonia varies 9 among institutions and settings primarily because of differences in patient populations, diagnostic methods employed, and definitions used (29;44;56-59;86-90). In general, however, bacteria have been the most frequently isolated pathogens.

The causative microbial agents of nosocomial pneumonia, including VAP, however, can vary depending on the length of time the patient has spent in the ICU and/or received mechanically assisted ventilation.

These findings echo those from previous studies of risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications, and underscore the major role of a patient’s underlying health status in the occurrence of post-operative pneumonia (18;386). Interventions aimed at reducing the postoperative patient's risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications have been developed; most measures have been geared towards clearing secretions and increasing lung expansion (387-391). These include deep breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, use of incentive spirometry and continuous positive airway pressure by face mask.

In addition, the risk of illness following exposure to a given source may be influenced by a number of factors other than the presence or concentration of microorganisms; these include the degree to which contaminated water is aerosolized into respirable droplets, the proximity of the infectious aerosol to potential host, the susceptibility of the host, and the virulence properties of the contaminating microbial strain (502;503).

PATHOGENESIS Pulmonary aspergillosis is acquired primarily by inhalation of the fungal spores. In severely immunocompromised patients, primary Aspergillus spp. pneumonia results from local lung tissue invasion (623;641;642).

Abnormalities detected by computerized tomography (CT) scanning often precede those detected by plain chest radiograph (657).

In addition to the host’s immune system status, other factors related to the organ- transplantation procedure may be associated with an increased risk of IPA.

Chemoprophylaxis Because of the difficulty of preventing patient exposures to Aspergillus spp. in the environment, chemoprophylaxis with antifungal agents has been employed in an effort to decrease the patient’s risk of IPA (718;719). However, its cost-effectiveness remains controversial. In trials with historical controls, the use of low-dose amphotericin B (up to 0.25 mg/kg/day) prophylaxis or oral fluconazole was associated with reduced deaths from aspergillosis in HSCT or lung-transplant recipients (720;721). In one study, low-dose amphotericin reduced early systemic fungal infections and improved patient survival (although the"

Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B, although less nephrotoxic than amphotericin B, are significantly more expensive and have not been shown to provide effective prophylaxis against IPA (723).

PREVENTION AND CONTROL Control of health-care-associated outbreaks of adenovirus infections can be very difficult and requires vigorous infection-control procedures primarily because of the virus’ ability to survive for long periods in the environment (862;865;873-875;889-891).

Influenza is transmitted from person to person primarily via virus-laden large droplets that are generated when infected persons cough, sneeze, or talk; these large droplets can then be directly deposited onto the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tracts of susceptible persons who are near the droplet source.

Strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well- designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB. Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by some clinical or epidemiologic studies and by strong theoretical rationale. Category IC. Required for implementation, as mandated by federal or state regulation or standard. Category II."
