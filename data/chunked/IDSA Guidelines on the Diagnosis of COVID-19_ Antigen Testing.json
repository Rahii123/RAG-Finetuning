Abstract Background: Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens (Ag) are commonly used to diagnose COVID-19. The most widely used tests are lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Ag assays have also been developed. The number of commercially available SARS- CoV-2 Ag detection tests has increased rapidly, as has the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best practice"

We categorized the assays as point-of-care versus laboratory-based assays based on the location where the test was completed, and results were interpreted. If the test was completed at the bedside immediately after specimen collection, it was considered as point-of-care. If the test was completed after transport of a specimen to a laboratory, it was considered laboratory based. The sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care Ag testing were 63% (95% CI: 28% to 88%) and 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%), respectively (Figures s14a, s14b).
