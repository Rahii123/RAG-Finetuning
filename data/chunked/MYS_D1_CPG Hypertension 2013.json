The prevalence of hypertension in Malaysians aged 18 years and above was 32.7% and for aged 30 years and above was 43.5% in 2011. Hypertension is a silent disease; the majority of cases"

Blood pressure should be measured at every chance encounter. Untreated or sub-optimally controlled hypertension leads to increased cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. A systolic BP of 120 to 139 and/or diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mmHg is defined as prehypertension and should be treated in certain high risk groups. Therapeutic lifestyle changes should be recommended for all individuals with hypertension and pre-hypertension. Decisions on pharmacological treatment should be based on global vascular risks and not on the level of blood pressure per se. In patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated hypertension and no"

This is the fourth in the series since it was first launched in 1998.

The results of the survey showed that the prevalence of hypertension has increased with very little difference in awareness rate and rate of blood pressure control in the hypertensive population. The rate of blood pressure control remained poor despite an increase in the prevalence of diagnosed patients who were prescribed antihypertensive medication. This may reflect the fact that clinicians are still not clear of the target blood pressure to achieve in their patients while on treatment.

The higher the BP, the greater the chance of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and kidney diseases. The presence of each additional risk factor, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or smoking status, compounds the risk.

Approximately 50-75% of individuals with GFR <60 ml/ min/1.73m2 (CKD stages 3–5) have hypertension.136 Hypertension accelerates the progression of renal disease and may lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Tight control of BP in patients with CKD is therefore important. The target BP should be <140/90 mmHg for patients with CKD33,137,138 (Level I) and <130/80 mmHg for those with proteinuria of ≥1g/24 hours.34 (Level I) All anti-hypertensive drug classes can be used to achieve this goal.
