Many terms have been used to describe this infection including “suppurative” [1-3], “purulent” [4-6], and “pyogenic” [7-9] arthritis.

These guidelines use the term “suspected” ABA for patients prior to the confirmation of the diagnosis by traditional microbiologic methods and/or molecular studies, after which the term “confirmed” is used. The term “presumed” is employed when all testing to identify a bacterial etiology has been negative, but the patient is treated as though they have ABA. Finally, the term “excluded” is used when this diagnosis is considered unlikely. There are over 200 joints in the human body, with a great diversity in structure and function [10]. The reported incidence of ABA in children from resource-rich Western countries is approximately 2- 10/100,000 children annually, but varies by pathogen, age, immunization status, joint involved, sex, and race/ethnicity [11-13]."

Although prospective, controlled studies reporting a consistent clinical and laboratory dataset collected from infected children have not been published, multiple retrospective reviews suggest differences in the clinical and laboratory presentation, clinical course, and outcomes between the two most common bacterial pathogens, S. aureus and K. kingae [16, 31, 32].

In contrast, the onset of symptoms for K. kingae infection in infants and preschool-aged children, the most common age groups for this pathogen, appears in many cases to be more indolent, less well-defined, with less severe symptoms and often without the rapid progression to severe pain and systemic symptoms usually seen with S. aureus. In addition, most children with K. kingae infection are young (infants or preschool-aged), with limited ability to share specific localizing symptoms [32, 33]. ABA occurring with associated contiguous osteomyelitis, particularly with S. aureus, is common. Metastatic sites of infection (distal or contiguous), appearing simultaneously with ABA are uncommon despite a presumed or confirmed preceding bacteremia. Notably, there is a lack"

Rationale for Recommendation The existing literature on antimicrobial therapy for pediatric ABA for S. aureus, K. kingae, and other pathogens is limited by the retrospective nature of published data, as well as inconsistent methodology, varied populations reported, non-standardized surgical management and limited patient datasets for clinical and laboratory assessment of disease at the time of treatment or at"

ABA due to non-typhoidal Salmonella spp, is seen primarily in developing countries and is typically food- or water-borne [131, 289]. Underlying hemoglobinopathy including sickle cell disease is also a risk factor. Reptile pet-associated Salmonella infections have also been reported in the United States [246]. These very limited data suggest these infections may need to be treated for 4 – 6 weeks. ABA can also be a manifestation of Brucella infections."

These include premature infants during the first months of life [302] and infants less than 6 months of age [303], as well as those with ABA of the hip or shoulder, and those with delay of diagnosis or definitive surgical management beyond 4 days into treatment [69, 139, 304-306] or other delays in antibiotic therapy or sterilization of synovial fluid. Infection caused by resistant organisms, such as CA-MRSA, have been associated with increased risk of growth arrest of the femur in some series. It is unclear whether this finding is related primarily to delay in receipt of effective antimicrobial therapy or the presence of a more virulent microbe (e.g., USA 300 S. aureus) in the hip joint [307]. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head as a consequence of ABA of"

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head as a consequence of ABA of the hip was recognized way before the global spread of USA 300 S. aureus during the past two decades. Children with any limitation in joint function at the end of acute therapy (such as decreased joint range of motion) should be followed closely by orthopedic specialists for complications or the need for ongoing management. Growth arrest can be typically detected within months from the initial infection; monitoring for growth arrest may be performed as part of ongoing routine wellchildcare by primary care providers as well as by orthopedic specialists. There are no data describing what can be done to prevent growth arrest, but orthopedic procedures to manage growth arrest can be performed if"

Rationale for Recommendation This conditional recommendation is based on very low certainty of evidence, and places high value on considerations of patient’s values and preferences, feasibility, acceptability, equity, and cost in recommending that children with either presumed or confirmed primary ABA who have substantial recovery at the end of acute management will not routinely require either orthopedic or infectious diseases follow-up. The recommendation for ongoing orthopedic specialist follow-up for ABA in children who appear to have higher risk of long-term complications with joint or bone growth or function as outlined above, places high value on identifying complications early"
