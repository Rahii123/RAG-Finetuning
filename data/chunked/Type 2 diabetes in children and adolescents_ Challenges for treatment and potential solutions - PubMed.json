Treating youth-onset T2DM poses numerous critical challenges, namely limited and inadequate therapeutic options, and difficulties with conducting therapeutic studies. As a result, current treatment guidelines are based on adult studies and expert consensus. Few prominent guidelines on the treatment of youth-onset T2DM have been published recently, i.e., by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2024, National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence United Kingdom (NICE UK) 2023, International Society Paediatric and Adolescents Diabetes (ISPAD) 2022, Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) 2020 and Diabetes Canada 2018.

    "content": "Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) 2020 and Diabetes Canada 2018. This review first explores the unique aspects of youth-onset T2DM. It then summarises the different treatment guidelines, discusses the different treatment modalities based on available evidence and identifies any gaps. The review also explores challenges in the treatment of youth-onset T2DM with potential solutions and discusses recent trials on the treatment of youth-onset T2DM. Continued research aims to optimise treatment, improve outcomes, and alleviate the burden of T2DM on youths.
