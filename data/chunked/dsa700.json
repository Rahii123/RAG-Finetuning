It is now the fourth leading cause of death in the Region and an estimated 22 million people have diabetes out of a total adult population of 290 million. This quick reference guide aims to provide a readily accessible overview of the evidence-based facts regarding the management of hypertension patients with diabetes mellitus. They have been formulated to help improve the detection and management of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus, and hence decrease the associated microvascular and macrovascular complications. Rationale • Macrovascular disease"

Rationale • Macrovascular disease constitutes the major cause of diabetes mellitus mortality, with 80% of patients having and/or dying of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease. Patients with diabetes exhibit a two to four-fold increase in risk of coronary events compared to non-diabetic individuals. • Although large-scale studies have shown a clear association between improvement in glycaemic control and reduction in microvascular end-organ damage (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy), they have not been able to show a consistent similar relationship between glycaemic control and macrovascular complications. • Many trials, however, have shown a benefit with respect to cardiovascular events,"

In addition, control of hypertension is also beneficial to microvascular complications. • This issue is of paramount importance since close to 60% of patients with diabetes are known to have hypertension. Therefore, aggressive strategies aimed at identifying and treating high blood pressure in patients with diabetes should lead to substantial reduction in the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. • It is important to emphasize that hypertension is but one element of the metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Definition and diagnosis of diabetes Definition • Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology, characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. • The effects of diabetes mellitus include long-term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs. Diagnosis • The diagnosis of diabetes in an asymptomatic individual should never be made on the basis of a single abnormal glucose value.

Smoking cessation should be highly recommended. • Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ß-blockers are good initial therapy options in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension (i.e. no evidence of nephropathy).
