Review of the Scientific Data\nRegarding Hand Hygiene\nHistorical Perspective\nFor generations, handwashing with soap and water has been\nconsidered a measure of personal hygiene (1). The concept of\ncleansing hands with an antiseptic agent probably emerged in\nthe early 19th century. As early as 1822, a French pharmacist\ndemonstrated that solutions containing chlorides of lime or\nsoda could eradicate the foul odors associated with human\ncorpses and that such solutions could be used as disinfectants\nand antiseptics (2).
