The ease of use and lower price per test relative to standard NAAT are attractive\nfeatures of rapid Ag testing. Overall, Ag testing had a sensitivity of 80% in symptomatic individuals\nand 63% in asymptomatic persons, with specificities of close to 100% in both populations,\ncompared to a single standard NAAT.
