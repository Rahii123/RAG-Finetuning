    "text": "(T2DM) among children and adolescents has been rising, mirroring the increasing rates of childhood\nobesity. Currently, youth-onset T2DM poses a significant public health challenge globally. Treating\nyouth-onset T2DM poses numerous critical challenges, namely limited and inadequate therapeutic\noptions, and difficulties with conducting therapeutic studies. As a result, current treatment guidelines\nare based on adult studies and expert consensus. Few prominent guidelines on the treatment of\nyouth-onset T2DM have been published recently, i.e., by the American Diabetes Association (ADA)\n2024, National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence United Kingdom (NICE UK) 2023, International\nSociety Paediatric and Adolescents Diabetes (ISPAD) 2022, Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group",

This review first explores the unique aspects of youth-onset\nT2DM. It then summarises the different treatment guidelines, discusses the different treatment\nmodalities based on available evidence and identifies any gaps. The review also explores challenges in\nthe treatment of youth-onset T2DM with potential solutions and discusses recent trials on the\ntreatment of youth-onset T2DM. Continued research aims to optimise treatment, improve outcomes,\nand alleviate the burden of T2DM on youths.\nKeywords: Adolescent Diabetes; Childhood Obesity; Diabetes Guidelines; Diabetes Management in\nAdolescents; Paediatric Diabetes; Type 2 diabetes.\nRelated information",
