The recommendations in this 6th edition CPG supersedes the 5th edition \nClinical Practice Guidelines on Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 2015.\nMOH/P/PAK/447.20(GU)-e\n3\nFOREWORD\nby Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, \nDirector General of Health, Malaysia\nManagement of any chronic disease requires a concerted effort with the \nparticipation of all stake holders starting with the patients themselves and, \nclinical healthcare professionals as well as public health policymakers. This is \neven more important in the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). \nAn optimum result can only be achieved with a holistic approach and active \npatient participation with the support of appropriate diabetes education \nand lifestyle modification. In addition to its negative impact on the quality \nof life and health care costs, diabetes also increases the economic burden of \nindividuals, families and communities and, affects national productivity.\nI note that there has been a recent explosion of advances made in the \nmanagement of diabetic complications. The use of new technology and findings \nfrom landmark trials have changed clinical pathways and recommendations in \nthe way T2DM is managed. This has been reflected in the latest Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM (6th Edition). These guidelines \nalso focus on preventing and reducing diabetes-related complications, \nthereby improving clinical outcomes. This CPG will form a valuable resource \nfor healthcare professionals from primary to tertiary care levels, to deliver the \nbest possible care for their patients, from disease prevention to treatment of \ncomplications.\n In this networked age, we should no longer be working in silos and I would \nlike to reaffirm the importance and recognition of a multidisciplinary approach \nin managing T2DM. I have been a champion for embracing technology and \ninnovation – and note that there is emphasis on the potential to use mobile \napps and other forms of technological advances / telemedicine to improve \ndiabetes self-management. The importance of this is even greater now in the \ncontext of the new norm forced on everyone by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe breadth and depth of material covered reflects the commitment and \nthe dedication of the CPG committee, despite the difficulties encountered \nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. I would like to congratulate the chairs and the \nmembers for their hard work and it is my sincere wish that this document will \nfurther elevate the standard of diabetes care and reduce the burden of T2DM \nin our country.\nTan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\n4\nFOREWORD\nby Chairpersons of T2DM Clinical Practice Guidelines, \n6th edition taskforce\nThese are exciting times for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) \nand a time for concern. The past 5 years have seen amazing breakthroughs that \ngive hope for people with T2DM. Several Cardiovascular Outcome trials (CVOTs) \nfrom 2 new classes of glucose-lowering agents have shown cardiovascular (CV) \nprotection, beyond glucose.\nOn the other hand, prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia continues to rise unabated. \nThe 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) shows a prevalence \nof 18.3% (for adults >18 years of age), a 4% increase from 2015; 48.6% were \nundiagnosed. In addition, ~5.0% of our young Malaysians between 18-29 years \nare also diabetic. It is worrying to see this trend. The frequent co-existence with \nother well-known comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, overweight/\nobesity further complicates the situation. \nThe 5th edition of our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of \nT2DM 2015, was detailed and comprehensive. Our aspiration was to build on \nthe previous CPG. Since then, there have been major advances; in therapeutics, \nnutrition, technology as well as, digital health. \nThe landmark CVOTs have consistently demonstrated positive beneficial CV \noutcomes in those with either established or at high risk for cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD). Another exciting advance has been the discovery of a 2nd \ntherapeutic class of agent, apart from the renin-angiotensin system blockers, \nto directly reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD remains \nthe largest contributor of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia and, \nrecent renal outcome trials definitively show positive outcomes for prevention \nof progression to end-stage renal failure and reduction of albuminuria. More \nexciting data may be forthcoming with ongoing dedicated trials investigating \neffects of these glucose-lowering agents, on heart failure and prevention \nof kidney disease not only in people with diabetes but also, in nondiabetic \nindividuals.\nThese results have led to paradigm shifts, changing practices as we move \nforward. The objective of these guidelines is to reflect the uptake of this \nnew data in clinical decision making and therefore, provide evidence-based \nrecommendations to assist healthcare providers in identifying, diagnosing and \nmanaging our patients with T2DM. Some of the other notable updates, include \nadditional sections on current hot topics; e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \n5\n(NAFLD) and periodontal disease. The landmark CVOTs have been consolidated \nand summarised in Appendix 8.\nT2DM is not a stand-alone disease instead reaching across a spectrum of other \nnon-communicable diseases. Hence, in this updated guideline, we expanded our \ntaskforce to include colleagues from other specialities; including nephrology, \nneurology, gastroenterology-hepatology, cardiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry \nand dental surgery. The committee hopes that this combination of expertise \nhas enhanced the recommendations in this CPG to further improve clinical \ndecision making. \nThe development of these guidelines extended into an extraordinary situation \ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it, the hardworking committee \nmembers of the taskforce, including our reviewers, persevered with continuous \nand timely discussions to reach consensus where required through use of \ntechnology/remote communication, enabling its completion. To this, we extend \nour appreciation and gratitude, and commend their unwavering commitment \nto deliver the best evidence-based standard of care to our patients with T2DM. \nForeword \nby Chairperson of T2DM Clinical Practice Guidelines, 6th edition taskforce\nDr Chan Siew Pheng\nChairperson\nDato’ Paduka Professor Dr Wan \nMohamad Wan Bebakar\nCo-chair\nDatuk Dr Zanariah Hussein\nCo-chair\n6\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\nGuidelines development\nThe guidelines development task force consisted of endocrinologists, paediatric \nendocrinologists, family medicine specialists, public health physicians, general \nphysicians and dietitians. Where relevant, experts from different specialties \nwere also included to review and update certain sub-sections within these \nguidelines. These included a nephrologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist-\nhepatologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, psychiatrist, dental surgeon, \npharmacist and diabetes educator.\nThe previous edition of the CPG on Management of T2DM 2015 was used as \nthe basis for the development of this present guideline.\nLiterature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: \nPUBMED, Medline, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and \nJournal full text via OVID search engine. In addition, the reference lists of all \nrelevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies.\nReference was also made to the lastest edition of other guidelines on the \nmanagement of T2DM including guidelines developed by the American \nDiabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, American \nAssociation of Clinical Endocrinologists’, American College of Endocrinology, \nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF) Global Guideline for Type 2 Diabetes, \nthe European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), National Institute \nFor Health and Care Excellence (NICE); Malaysian CPG on Management of \nObesity, Canadian Diabetes Association, The Royal Australian College of \nGeneral Practitioners and Diabetes Australia, Malaysian Dietitians’ Association, \nTrafford NHS Healthcare Trust and Joint British Diabetes Societies Inpatient \nCare Group.\nThese updated guidelines also include the latest cardiovascular outcome trials \n(CVOTs) and findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses in literature, \nall whilst taking into consideration local practices.\nClinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of \nthe task force were assigned individual topics within these subgroups. All \nliterature retrieved were critically appraised, presented and discussed during \ngroup meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were \n7\nagreed by the task force members. Where the evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the task force members. \nThe articles were graded using the criteria used by the Canadian Task Force \non the Periodic Health Examination, while the grading of recommendation in \nthis guideline was standardised with the previous edition of the T2DM CPG \n(5th edition) i.e. following the American Heart Association system, for easy \ncomparison. The rationale for the committee to do so is that the format for \nboth are familiar to our healthcare professionals and facilitates the CPG’s ease \nof use.\nThe draft guidelines as a whole were submitted for external review by experts \nin endocrinology (adult and paediatric) and family medicine, whilst relevant \nsub-sections by consult with a neurologist, nephrologist, gastroenterologist-\nhepatologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, diabetes educator, psychiatrist \nand dental surgeon. These guidelines were then presented to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Health Technology \nAssessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia \nfor review and approval.\nObjectives\nThe aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations to \nassist healthcare providers in the identification, diagnosis and management of \npatients with T2DM.\nClinical questions\n1.\t\nWhat are the most effective methods to diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetes \nindividuals and, strategies to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic \nindividuals, including adolescents?\n2.\t\nWhat team-based structured diabetes educational interventions and \ninitiatives have been proven to successfully improve patient self-\nmanagement?\n3.\t\nWhat nutrition interventions have been proven to effectively prevent, \ndelay the development of T2DM or reverse diabetes in recently diagnosed \nT2DM individuals?\n4.\t\nWhat are the recommended indications for self-blood glucose monitoring \n(SMBG) in T2DM and the role of mobile health in this form of monitoring \nstrategy?\n5.\t\nWhat are the thresholds for BP levels for initiation of anti-hypertensive \nmedication in individuals with T2DM and what are the BP targets?\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\n8\n6.\t\nHow are patients risk stratified for LDL-lowering therapy in T2DM?\n7.\t\nHas metabolic surgery come-of-age in the management of obese patients \nwith T2DM and what is its role?\n8.\t\nHow prevalent is NAFLD in individuals with T2DM and what is its clinical \nsignificance?\n9.\t\nWhat is the recommended practical approach to treat diabetic emergencies?\n10.\t What does the evidence say about the possibility of delaying progression \nof DKD to ESKD?\n11.\t How should the CV benefits documented in the recent landmark CVOTs in \nT2DM patients with established CVD or high risk of CVD influence clinical \nmanagement?\n12.\t Is diabetes distress/depression a common problem and how does it \ninfluence diabetes management?\n13.\t How does periodontal disease affect management of T2DM and how can it \nbest be managed?\n14.\t What are the effective and safe management strategies of individuals with \nT2DM in the following situations?\na.\t In acute illness/pre- and post-operation\nb.\t In the elderly with a special focus on cognitive assessment/dementia \nand co-morbidities\nc.\t During Ramadan\n15.\t How should complementary and alternative medicine be addressed in the \nholistic management of T2DM?\nUpdated and new contents:\nMajor changes in these guidelines are:\n1.\t\nInclusion of Periodontal disease, Peripheral arterial disease and Non-\nalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n2.\t\nInclusion of Summary of Updates at the beginning of each chapter which, \nhighlights the important new advances and issues requiring emphasis.\n3.\t\nReplacement of the term chronic kidney disease (CKD) to diabetic kidney \ndisease (DKD).\n4.\t\nReplacement of the term oral anti-glycaemic drugs (OAD) to oral glucose \nlowering drugs (OGLDs) and glucose lowering drugs (GLD).\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\n9\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\n5.\t\nDiabetes in pregnancy is not included as it has its dedicated CPG on \nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy launched in 2018.

continuum ranging \nfrom prediabetes, consisting of impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) and impaired \nglucose tolerance (IGT), to overt diabetes mellitus.\n•\t Prediabetes usually does not cause symptoms and is characterised by \nelevated plasma glucose levels that fall below the threshold to diagnose \ndiabetes. Prediabetes is an important risk factor for future diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a potentially reversible condition with \nlifestyle modification.\n•\t T2DM is the most common form of diabetes mellitus, accounting for >90% of \nall cases of adult-onset diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. Both prediabetes and \ndiabetes commonly coexist with other non-communicable diseases namely \nhypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity.\n•\t With a high and increasing global, and local prevalence, T2DM represents a \nhuge socio-economic burden due to increased morbidity from accelerated \nvascular complications and premature death.\n•\t T2DM is characterised by progressive decline in beta-cell function associated \nwith insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue.\n›\t The insulin resistant state results in increased hepatic glucose output and \nreduced utilisation of glucose by various organs contributing to fasting \nhyperglycaemia and between meal hyperglycaemia.\n›\t Impaired intestinal incretin secretion causes compromised meal-related \ninsulin secretion and glucagon suppression contributing to postprandial \nhyperglycaemia.\n›\t Excessive renal tubular reabsorption of glucose further contributes to \nhyperglycaemia.\n•\t T2DM is an important risk factor for CVD and microvascular complications \nsuch as nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy.

It is also used \nin insulin pumps.\n›\t Basal insulin is administered once or twice daily. The intermediate or long-\nacting pharmacokinetic profile covers the basal insulin requirements in \nbetween meals and through the night.\n71\nSECTION 3\nMANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS\n›\t Premixed insulin is biphasic insulin that incorporates both the short \nor rapid-acting insulin with intermediate-acting insulin into a single \npreparation to cover for both postprandial glucose excursion as well as \nbasal insulin needs.\n›\t Co-formulation insulin is a combination of a rapid acting and basal insulin \nexisting separately in one formulation.

First generation \nsulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide): generally, should be avoided due to long half-life and risk of \nhypoglycaemia in patients with CKD. Gliclazide and glipizide are the preferred agents among the second-\ngeneration sulphonylureas as they do not have active metabolites and have lower risk of hypoglycaemia \nin CKD patients.\n§ Metformin is eliminated via kidney and may accumulate in body as kidney function deteriorates, increase \nrisk of lactic acidosis.\n ¶SGLT2-i – eGFR below which this class of agents can be prescibed is expected to change, with the advent \nof their significant reno-protective and cardio-protective benefits; however, the indication may be for \ntheir reno and cardio-protective benefits rather than specifically for glucose lowering.
